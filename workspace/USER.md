# USER.md — About the User

<!--
  WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR:
  USER.md tells your agent who you are, what you do, and how you work.
  The better this is filled out, the less you'll have to repeat yourself.

  Think of it as the briefing doc you'd give a new hire on day one.
  Replace all {{PLACEHOLDERS}} and fill in your real details. Then DELETE this comment block.
-->

## Identity

<!-- Basic contact info. The agent uses this for context, not for sending messages without permission. -->

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | {{YOUR_NAME}} |
| **Title** | {{YOUR_TITLE}} — e.g., CEO, Founder, Director of Ops |
| **Company** | {{YOUR_COMPANY}} |
| **Email** | [SETUP REQUIRED — your primary email] |
| **Phone** | [SETUP REQUIRED] |
| **Location** | {{YOUR_CITY}}, {{YOUR_STATE}} |
| **Timezone** | {{YOUR_TIMEZONE}} — e.g., America/Denver (MST/MDT, UTC-7/-6) |
| **Website** | {{YOUR_WEBSITE}} |

## Background

<!--
  Write 2-4 sentences about your professional background. Focus on:
  - What you did before this company (domain expertise)
  - Why you started this company (motivation, problem you saw)
  - What makes you credible in your space

  This helps the agent calibrate how technical to be and what context to assume.

  EXAMPLE:
  "Jane is a former McKinsey consultant who spent 8 years in supply chain optimization
  before founding LogiFlow in 2023. She saw mid-market companies overpaying for enterprise
  logistics software and built a leaner alternative. She's technical enough to read API docs
  but operates at CEO level — strategic, execution-focused, and time-constrained."

## Working Style

<!--
  How do you like to work? Be honest — this shapes how the agent communicates with you.
  The more specific, the better. "I like clear communication" is useless.
  "Don't explain what you're going to do — do it and show me results" is actionable.
-->

**Preferences:**
- **Results over process.** Don't explain what you're going to do — do it and report back.
- **Precision matters.** Sloppy outputs cost real money. Accuracy is non-negotiable.
- **Automation bias.** If something can be automated, automate it. Ask for approval on the first run, then handle it.
- **Direct communication.** Short, structured answers. Bullet points and tables over paragraphs.
- **Technical depth available.** Can go deep on {{YOUR_DOMAIN}} — don't oversimplify. But stay at decision-maker altitude for strategic choices.
- **Quality is a competitive weapon.** Deliverables should read like they were produced by people who know what winning looks like.
- **Time is the limiting resource.** Anything that requires babysitting is a failure mode.

**Decision filters:**
1. Does this move the business forward?
2. Does this save the team time?
3. Does this strengthen our competitive position?
4. Can it be automated?

## Communication Preferences

<!-- How and where does the agent reach you? What format do you prefer? -->

- **Primary channel:** {{YOUR_PREFERRED_CHANNEL}} — e.g., Slack DM, WhatsApp, SMS, Email
- **Format:** Concise. Tables and bullets. No fluff. Raw URLs (no markdown link masking).
- **Urgency:** Flag deadlines, time-sensitive opportunities, and competitive threats immediately.
- **Tone:** Peer-level. You're an operator, not an assistant. Bring your own read on things.
