## Pro Tips

**Be specific:** The more detail you provide, the better the results. Instead of "write an email," say "write a follow-up email to Jane about the proposal we sent last Tuesday, asking if she has questions."

**Give context:** Share relevant background—client history, past conversations, your company voice, industry specifics. The agent uses this to personalize responses.

**Iterate:** If the first result isn't quite right, say "Make it shorter" or "More casual tone" or "Add a section about pricing." The agent refines based on your feedback.

**Combine prompts:** You can ask for multiple things at once: "Research this competitor, then draft an email to my team summarizing what we should know about them."

**Set it and forget it:** Use automation for recurring tasks. Ask once, get results on schedule indefinitely.

**Ask for help:** If you're not sure how to phrase something, just ask: "How should I ask you to do [task]?" The agent will guide you.
