# Your First 30 Minutes

You just set up your AI operator. Here's how to get real value from it in the next 30 minutes—no technical knowledge required.

## Minute 0-5: Say Hello

Your agent is ready to learn about you and your business. Just start a conversation.

**What to do:** Type "Hey" or "Hello" in the chat and answer the questions it asks.

The agent will ask about:
- What you do
- Who your clients are
- What your typical day looks like
- What takes up most of your time

Just answer naturally, like you're talking to a new assistant. The more it knows, the more helpful it becomes.

## Minute 5-10: Ask It Something Real

Don't test it with small talk. Give it actual work. Here are three prompts you can copy and paste right now:

**Copy-paste these:**

> "Research my top 3 competitors and tell me what they're doing better than us"

> "Write a follow-up email for [client name] about [topic we discussed]"

> "What's happening in [your industry] this week that I should know about?"

Replace the parts in [brackets] with your actual info. The agent will go research, write, or analyze—then come back with real results.

## Minute 10-20: Give It Context

The agent works better when it knows more about your business. You can feed it information right in the chat.

**What to share:**
- Company background or about page
- Client lists or CRM exports
- Your bio or LinkedIn profile
- Past proposals or reports
- Product descriptions
- Common emails you send

**How to share:** Just paste the text directly in chat, or say "Here's our company background" and drop it in.

The agent remembers this information and uses it to give better answers, write in your voice, and understand your priorities.

## Minute 20-30: Set Up Autopilot

This is where it gets powerful. Ask the agent to do recurring tasks automatically.

**Copy-paste these:**

> "Set up a morning briefing for me at 7am with news about [your industry], my calendar for the day, and anything urgent"

> "Every Monday morning, review my pipeline and tell me which deals need attention"

> "Alert me if any major news breaks about [competitor name] or [key topic]"

The agent will set these up and run them on schedule. You'll get the results delivered to your chat, email, or wherever you want them.

## What NOT to Worry About

**You don't need to learn:**
- Code or programming
- Terminal commands
- Complex configurations
- Technical jargon

If you can send a text message, you can use this. The agent handles all the technical stuff behind the scenes.

**You don't need to:**
- Set up integrations manually (just ask the agent to do it)
- Remember special commands (just talk naturally)
- Worry about breaking anything (the agent won't let you)

## What to Try Next

Now that you've got the basics, explore what else your agent can do:

1. **Check out EXAMPLE-PROMPTS.md** for dozens of ready-to-use prompts organized by category
2. **Ask the agent:** "What are some useful things you can do for someone in [your industry]?"
3. **Start delegating:** Take a task you do every week and ask the agent to handle it
4. **Build routines:** Set up daily, weekly, or monthly automated workflows

The more you use it, the better it gets at understanding your needs.

## Need Help?

Just ask the agent: "I'm not sure what to do next" or "What should I try?" It's designed to guide you.

Welcome aboard. Let's get to work.
